## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 21:10 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 11: ScreenshotCard + InterleavedView)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Replaced the JSON-dump placeholder in SessionWindow with a real card-based UI. Created `ScreenshotCard.tsx` — an `<article>` component that shows a 160×120 thumbnail (loaded via the Tauri asset protocol), an editable caption (inline single-click editing with Enter/blur-to-save), a transcript narration textarea, and re-record/delete icon buttons with placeholder event-dispatch handlers. Created `InterleavedView.tsx` that maps all session screenshots to `ScreenshotCard` components (last card flagged `isActive`), appends a dashed "Take next screenshot" call-to-action button, and renders a closing narration textarea below. Rewrote `SessionWindow.tsx` to route through `InterleavedView`, adding `requestDelete` (confirmation dialog + `move_to_deleted` Tauri invoke + `DELETE_SCREENSHOT` dispatch) and `requestRerecord` (fires `vp-rerecord-segment` CustomEvent; real modal in Task 15). To enable `convertFileSrc` to load PNGs from the `~/Pictures/VisionPipe/` folder, added `assetProtocol` scope to `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and added the `protocol-asset` feature to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`. TypeScript: 0 errors; all 18 tests pass; Vite build: 227.50 KB JS bundle; `cargo check`: clean (only pre-existing warnings).

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/components/ScreenshotCard.tsx`** (created) — `Props`: `screenshot`, `isActive`, `onOpenLightbox`, `onRequestRerecord`, `onRequestDelete`. Uses `convertFileSrc` from `@tauri-apps/api/core` to build the asset URL from `session.folder + canonicalName + .png`. Caption area toggles between a styled `<div>` (click to edit, shows amber caption or dimmed italic placeholder) and an `<input>` (autoFocus, Enter/blur saves via `UPDATE_CAPTION` dispatch). Transcript is a `<textarea>` with live `UPDATE_TRANSCRIPT_SEGMENT` dispatch. Re-record (🎙) and delete (🗑) buttons are transparent icon buttons with 28×28 sizing. Active card gets teal border; inactive gets standard `C.border`.
- **`src/components/InterleavedView.tsx`** (created) — maps `session.screenshots` to `ScreenshotCard` (last index = `isActive`). Below cards: dashed "＋ Take next screenshot" button; "CLOSING NARRATION" labeled textarea dispatching `UPDATE_CLOSING_NARRATION`.
- **`src/components/SessionWindow.tsx`** (rewritten) — added `useState<number | null>` for future lightbox seq (no UI yet; Task 12). `requestDelete` finds the target screenshot, shows a `confirm()` dialog, invokes `move_to_deleted`, then dispatches `DELETE_SCREENSHOT`. `requestRerecord` fires `vp-rerecord-segment` CustomEvent (real modal in Task 15). `<main>` now mounts `InterleavedView` instead of the JSON dump pre-tag; removed `padding: 16` from `<main>` (InterleavedView owns its own padding).
- **`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`** (modified) — added `"assetProtocol": { "enable": true, "scope": ["$PICTURE/VisionPipe/**"] }` alongside the existing `"csp": null` inside `app.security`. No other fields changed.
- **`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`** (modified) — added `"protocol-asset"` to the tauri dependency features list (required by Cargo build script when `assetProtocol` is enabled in tauri.conf.json; build script errors without it).

### Potential concerns to address:

- The `protocol-asset` Cargo feature downloads one new crate (`http-range v0.1.5`) and slightly increases the binary. This is the expected trade-off for native asset serving.
- The Lightbox click handler (`onOpenLightbox`) stores the seq in state but renders nothing — Task 12 will add the actual modal.
- The re-record button fires a DOM event; Task 15 adds the ReRecordModal that listens for it.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 21:02 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 10: Footer bar + Copy & Send)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Implemented the Footer component with "Take next screenshot" button and "Copy & Send" primary action as the bottom chrome of the SessionWindow. Created `src/components/Footer.tsx` with a flexbox footer layout (transparent left button, teal right button) and wired it into SessionWindow.tsx with two event handlers: `onTakeNextScreenshot` dispatches a CustomEvent to trigger capture mode, and `onCopyAndSend` renders the session to markdown via the existing `renderMarkdown()` utility, writes the markdown to clipboard via `@tauri-apps/plugin-clipboard-manager`, and persists the markdown to `{sessionFolder}/transcript.md` via the Tauri `write_session_file` command. App.tsx already had the `vp-take-next-screenshot` event listener from Task 7, so no modification was needed. The Footer footer receives a tooltip showing the screenshot count + transcript. TypeScript compilation 0 errors; all 18 tests still pass (no new tests for Footer — component is visual scaffolding); Vite build succeeds (223.55 KB JS bundle).

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/components/Footer.tsx`** (created) — exports `Footer` component with `Props` interface: `onTakeNextScreenshot` (function), `onCopyAndSend` (async function), `copyTooltip` (string), and `busy` (boolean). Layout is flexbox row (justify-between) on deepForest background with top border. Left button (transparent, borderLight border) shows "＋ Take next screenshot" with disabled cursor when busy. Right button (teal background, bold) shows "📋 Copy & Send" with HTML entity for ampersand, disabled when busy, with title tooltip.
- **`src/components/SessionWindow.tsx`** (modified) — added imports for `Footer`, `renderMarkdown`, `writeText` from `@tauri-apps/plugin-clipboard-manager`, and `invoke` from `@tauri-apps/api/core`. Added `onCopyAndSend` async handler that calls `renderMarkdown(session)`, writes to clipboard via `writeText()`, encodes to bytes, and invokes `write_session_file` to persist as `transcript.md`. Added `takeNext` handler that dispatches the `vp-take-next-screenshot` CustomEvent. Changed layout from 2-section to 3-section (header, main with scrollable content, footer). Header `onOpenSessionFolder` now uses the `session` const instead of `state.session?.folder`. Pre-existing JSON dump moved into `<main>` element for proper flex layout. Footer mounted with both handlers, computed tooltip.
- **`src/App.tsx`** — verified the `vp-take-next-screenshot` event listener exists at lines 28-32; no modifications needed.

### Potential concerns to address:

- None.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 21:00 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 9: Header bar)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Implemented the Header component as visual scaffolding for the SessionWindow. Created `src/lib/ui-tokens.ts` exporting the shared earthy color palette (teal, amber, cream, forest, etc.) and font constants extracted from the prior App.tsx, ensuring visual consistency across the session UI. Created `src/components/Header.tsx` with mic indicator (status dot, recording label with network state), view mode toggle (interleaved/split), and overflow menu (three-option prompt-based menu: new session, open folder, settings). The Header reads the current session from context and renders the session ID as a monospace label with clickable-to-copy folder path. Modified `src/components/SessionWindow.tsx` to mount the Header above a fullscreen flex layout with the JSON dump. No functional mic/network state yet (placeholder values: `micRecording=false`, `networkState="local-only"`; real state lands in Phase E). TypeScript compilation 0 errors; all 18 tests still pass (no new tests for Header — component is visual scaffolding); Vite build succeeds (220 KB JS bundle).

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/lib/ui-tokens.ts`** (created) — exports color constant object `C` (16 colors: teal, amber, cream, forest, deepForest, sienna, textBright, textMuted, textDim, border, borderLight) and two font constants (`FONT_BODY = "Verdana, sans-serif"`, `FONT_MONO = "'Source Code Pro', Menlo, monospace"`). Used throughout Header and intended for all future session UI components.
- **`src/components/Header.tsx`** (created) — exports `Header` component with `Props` interface: `micRecording` (boolean), `micPermissionDenied` (boolean), `networkState` ("live" | "local-only" | "reconnecting"), and five event callbacks (`onToggleMic`, `onToggleViewMode`, `onOpenSettings`, `onNewSession`, `onOpenSessionFolder`). Helper functions: `dotColor()` maps network state + recording flag to indicator dot color (red when live+recording, amber when reconnecting, muted otherwise), `networkLabel()` maps network state to label string. Header layout is flexbox row (3 sections: logo+session-id, centered mic button, right-aligned view toggle + overflow menu). Mic button shows status dot + "Recording · {networkLabel}" or "Paused". View toggle button shows "Detach transcript" (interleaved mode) or "Attach transcript" (split mode) with ◫ icon. `OverflowMenu` helper renders ⋮ button with a prompt-based menu (v0.2 temporary; real popover lands in polish phase).
- **`src/components/SessionWindow.tsx`** (modified) — replaced placeholder with Header integration. Changed layout from padding-only to `display: flex; flexDirection: column; height: 100vh` (fullscreen). Added `Header` import and component mount with hardcoded props (all callbacks dispatch reducer actions or alert; `micRecording=false`, `networkState="local-only"`). Pre-existing JSON dump moved into scrollable area below header. Functional view toggle connected: `onToggleViewMode` dispatches `TOGGLE_VIEW_MODE` action; `onNewSession` dispatches `END_SESSION` action.

### Potential concerns to address:

- None.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 20:58 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 8: persistence + debounced writes)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Implemented auto-persistence for `transcript.json` by creating a debounced write layer that triggers on every session state change. Created `src/state/persistence.ts` with `scheduleSessionWrite()` function that debounces writes 500ms by default but flushes immediately for high-priority actions (screenshot capture, delete, re-record). Modified `src/state/session-context.tsx` to wire the persistence layer into the reducer via a useEffect that detects action type and invokes the appropriate flush mode. The implementation preserves the Session data to disk at `{sessionFolder}/transcript.json` via the existing `write_session_file` Tauri command. TypeScript compilation 0 errors; all 18 tests still pass (no new tests for persistence — mocking Tauri's `invoke` is out of scope for this task).

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/state/persistence.ts`** (created) — exports `scheduleSessionWrite(session: Session, immediate?: boolean)` function managing a debounce queue. Internal state: `pending` (the session to write), `timer` (the debounce timeout ID), `DEBOUNCE_MS` constant (500). `flush()` async function encodes the session to JSON, converts to `Uint8Array`, and invokes `write_session_file` with folder, filename ("transcript.json"), and bytes array. When `immediate=true`, cancels any pending timeout and calls `flush()` immediately; otherwise re-arms the timeout. Error handling: console.error on Tauri invoke failure, does not re-throw.
- **`src/state/session-context.tsx`** (modified) — added imports for `useEffect` and `useRef` hooks, plus `scheduleSessionWrite`. Added `IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS` Set listing action types that should flush immediately: `APPEND_SCREENSHOT`, `DELETE_SCREENSHOT`, `SET_RE_RECORDED_AUDIO`. Changed `SessionProvider` to wrap `baseDispatch` in a custom `dispatch` function that records `lastActionType` before calling reducer, enabling the effect to detect high-priority actions. Added useEffect hook on `state.session` that calls `scheduleSessionWrite` with `immediate` flag determined by whether the last action was in `IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS`. Effect has no cleanup (timeouts auto-cancel on re-invoke).

### Potential concerns to address:

- None.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 21:00 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 7: App.tsx rewrite to session router)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Replaced the monolithic 1,262-line `App.tsx` (single-screenshot composite-image flow with annotation panel, sidebar, credits HUD, onboarding card, and canvas rendering) with a thin 90-line idle/session router built around `SessionProvider`. Extracted the region-select drag logic into `SelectionOverlay.tsx`, preserving the load-bearing `outerPosition()` + `devicePixelRatio` screen-coordinate math. Created placeholder `SessionWindow.tsx` (JSON dump; real UI comes in Tasks 9-12) and `IdleScreen.tsx` (hotkey hint). The new `AppInner` listens for `start-capture` from Rust and `vp-take-next-screenshot` from the session window, calls `create_session_folder` + `write_session_file` + `get_metadata` + `generateCanonicalName` on each capture, dispatches `START_SESSION` and `APPEND_SCREENSHOT` into the session reducer, then shows/focuses the window. TypeScript 0 errors, Vite build 216 KB JS bundle, all 18 tests still pass.

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/App.tsx`** (full rewrite, 1,262 → 90 lines) — `AppMode` trimmed to `"idle" | "selecting" | "session"`; `AppInner` component inside `SessionProvider`; listens for `start-capture` Tauri event and `vp-take-next-screenshot` DOM event; `onCapture` callback invokes `get_metadata`, `create_session_folder` (first capture only), `write_session_file`, dispatches `START_SESSION` then `APPEND_SCREENSHOT`; `onCancelCapture` returns to session or hides window. Discarded: composite canvas, `measureImageDims`, annotation textarea, credits HUD, voice recording, onboarding flow, `ToolButton`, `ChromeBar`, `Onboarding`, `PermissionRow`, `KbdKey` components.
- **`src/components/SelectionOverlay.tsx`** (created) — self-contained crosshair overlay; `completeSelection` uses `win.outerPosition()` and `window.devicePixelRatio` (identical math to old App.tsx) to compute screen-absolute coords before calling `take_screenshot`; `captureFullscreen` calls `capture_fullscreen`; both convert data URI → `Uint8Array` and call `onCapture` prop; Escape/Enter key handlers wired.
- **`src/components/SessionWindow.tsx`** (created) — placeholder; reads `state.session` from `useSession()`, renders session ID, screenshot count, and JSON dump. Returns null if no session.
- **`src/components/IdleScreen.tsx`** (created) — static centered hint "Press Cmd+Shift+C to start a capture session."

### Potential concerns to address:

- `SelectionOverlay` does NOT call `win.hide()` before capture (the old App.tsx did, with a 300 ms delay to avoid baking the overlay into the screenshot). The new overlay relies on Tauri's transparent window being invisible enough during `screencapture`; if the overlay bleeds into captures on M-series Macs, restore the `win.hide()` + 300 ms delay pattern inside `completeSelection`.
- The onboarding/permissions flow is entirely gone. If any user hits missing permissions, there's no in-app guidance. This is intentional for this phase — a new onboarding task (post Phase D) should restore it.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 21:00 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 6: markdown renderer)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Added a pure TypeScript markdown renderer that converts a `Session` object into a clipboard-ready markdown string — the primary output format consumed by Claude Code in Spec 1. Followed strict TDD: fixture JSON and golden `.expected.md` files written first, test file created next (confirmed 4 failures), then `src/lib/markdown-renderer.ts` implemented to match byte-for-byte. The renderer handles: session header with folder/audio paths and computed duration, per-screenshot sections with inline image references, conditional caption/URL/narration blocks, offline transcription fallback text with audio-offset timestamps, conditional closing narration section, and the VisionPipe footer. Total test suite advances from 14 to 18 tests across 3 files.

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/lib/__tests__/__fixtures__/session-2-screenshots.json`** (created) — fixture Session with 2 screenshots (Chrome + VSCode), full `CaptureMetadata`, audio offsets, captions, transcript segments, and closing narration.
- **`src/lib/__tests__/__fixtures__/session-2-screenshots.expected.md`** (created) — golden output fixture defining the exact markdown contract; tested byte-for-byte against renderer output.
- **`src/lib/__tests__/markdown-renderer.test.ts`** (created) — 4 tests: golden fixture match, offline narration fallback text, empty closing narration omission, and caption-block omission when caption is empty.
- **`src/lib/markdown-renderer.ts`** (created) — exports `renderMarkdown(session: Session): string`. Helpers: `formatDuration`, `sessionDurationSec`, `friendlyTs` (ISO → `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`), `renderContext`, `renderNarration` (offline fallback branch), `renderScreenshot`. No external dependencies.

### Potential concerns to address:

- None.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 21:00 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 5: session reducer + Context)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Added a `useReducer`-based session state manager and React Context provider as the central frontend state layer for multi-screenshot sessions. Created `src/state/session-reducer.ts` exporting `SessionState`, `SessionAction` (13 action variants), `initialState`, and `sessionReducer` — a pure function covering the full session lifecycle: start/end, screenshot append (with automatic audioOffset.end stamping on the prior entry), delete (preserving seq gaps), caption/transcript updates, offline marking, re-recorded audio, closing narration, and view mode toggling. Created `src/state/session-context.tsx` with `SessionProvider` (wraps `useReducer`) and `useSession` hook (throws if used outside provider). All 6 new reducer tests pass; total suite is 14 tests across 2 files. TDD: test file written first, confirmed failing, then implementation landed.

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/state/__tests__/session-reducer.test.ts`** (created) — 6 tests covering: idle initial state, START_SESSION, APPEND_SCREENSHOT with audioOffset.end stamping, DELETE_SCREENSHOT with seq-gap preservation, UPDATE_CAPTION by seq, and TOGGLE_VIEW_MODE round-trip.
- **`src/state/session-reducer.ts`** (created) — exports `SessionState` interface, `initialState` constant, `SessionAction` discriminated union (13 variants), and `sessionReducer` pure function. Helper `touch()` stamps `updatedAt` on every mutating action. All state transitions are immutable (spread-based). No external dependencies.
- **`src/state/session-context.tsx`** (created) — exports `SessionProvider` component (wraps `useReducer(sessionReducer, initialState)` in `SessionContext.Provider`) and `useSession()` hook (throws descriptive error when used outside provider). Uses React 19 `createContext` / `useContext` / `useReducer`.

### Potential concerns to address:

- None.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 21:00 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 4: Rust session folder management)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Implemented Rust session folder management as a new `session` module with four pub functions: `visionpipe_root()` resolves `~/Pictures/VisionPipe/` via the `dirs` crate, `create_session_folder()` creates `session-<id>/` with a `.deleted/` subdirectory, `write_session_file()` writes arbitrary bytes to a named file inside the folder, and `move_to_deleted()` soft-deletes files by renaming them into `.deleted/`. Three new Tauri commands (`create_session_folder`, `write_session_file`, `move_to_deleted`) are wired into the `invoke_handler` in `lib.rs`. Both Rust unit tests pass; `cargo check` is clean (pre-existing warnings only).

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src-tauri/src/session.rs`** (created) — new module with four pub functions and two unit tests verifying folder creation (with `.deleted/` subdirectory) and byte-accurate file writes. Uses `chrono` for test-unique IDs; test cleanup removes created directories.
- **`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`** — added `mod session;` declaration alongside existing module declarations; added three `#[tauri::command]` async functions (`create_session_folder`, `write_session_file`, `move_to_deleted`) delegating to `session::*`; added all three to the `.invoke_handler()` list.
- **`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`** — added `dirs = "5"` under `[dependencies]` for cross-platform user-directory resolution.
- **`src-tauri/Cargo.lock`** — updated by cargo to record the new `dirs` v5 and its transitive dependency `dirs-sys`.

### Potential concerns to address:

- None.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 20:45 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 3: canonical name generator)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Implemented the canonical screenshot name generator as a pure TypeScript function with TDD methodology. Created `src/lib/canonical-name.ts` exporting `generateCanonicalName()` and `sanitizeContext()`, which convert app + URL/window title metadata into filesystem-safe 180-char-max filenames. All 8 test cases pass; tests verify URL parsing, fallback to window title, app name normalization, path-unsafe character stripping, em-dash handling, and length capping.

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/lib/canonical-name.ts`** (created) — exports two pure functions:
  - `generateCanonicalName(input: NameInput)` — builds name pattern `VisionPipe-{seq}-{timestamp}-{app}-{context}` with 3-digit zero-padded sequence, app name shortening (Google Chrome → Chrome, Visual Studio Code → VSCode, etc.), URL-to-context extraction (extracts hostname + path from URL), fallback to window title, and hard cap at 180 chars by truncating context only.
  - `sanitizeContext(input: string)` — strips path-unsafe chars (`/\:*?"<>|—–`), collapses whitespace to dashes, collapses dash runs, and trims leading/trailing dashes.
  - Helper `urlToContext()` — parses URL, extracts hostname + pathname, sanitizes, returns context string or empty on parse failure.
  - Helper `shortenAppName()` — consults normalization table (Google Chrome → Chrome, etc.) or falls back to removing .app suffix and "Inc." suffix.
- **`src/lib/__tests__/canonical-name.test.ts`** (created) — 8 test cases verifying: URL extraction, window title fallback, app-only fallback, 3-digit padding, 180-char length cap with context truncation, path-unsafe char stripping (including em-dash), dash collapse/trim, and app name normalization.

### Potential concerns to address:

- **None.** Pure functions with no external dependencies. TDD: tests written first, all 8 now pass. Ready for integration with capture logic in subsequent tasks.

# Branch Progress: feature/multi-screenshot-bundle

This document tracks progress on the `feature/multi-screenshot-bundle` branch. It is updated with each commit and serves as a context handoff for any future LLM picking up this work.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 20:45 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 2: TypeScript session types)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Created the core TypeScript data model for multi-screenshot sessions: `src/types/session.ts` exports four types that define the session structure, capture metadata, audio offsets, and screenshots. The types align with the specification in docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-02-multi-screenshot-narrated-bundle-design.md and serve as the foundation for all session-related frontend state management and API contracts in Spec 1.

### Detail of changes made:

- **`src/types/session.ts`** (created) — new file in new directory `src/types/`. Exports five TypeScript types:
  - `CaptureMetadata` (interface): 24 properties capturing environment + window + system state at capture time (app, os, cpu, memory, display info, timezone, locale, dark mode, battery, uptime, etc.)
  - `AudioOffset` (interface): two properties (start and end timestamps in seconds) positioning each screenshot segment within audio-master.webm
  - `Screenshot` (interface): core data type with 8 properties (seq, canonicalName, capturedAt, audioOffset, caption, transcriptSegment, reRecordedAudio, metadata, offline)
  - `ViewMode` (type alias): union of "interleaved" | "split" for the UI view toggle
  - `Session` (interface): 8 properties (id, folder, createdAt, updatedAt, audioFile, viewMode, screenshots[], closingNarration)
- **Verified TypeScript compilation**: `pnpm tsc --noEmit` exits 0 with no errors (pre-existing errors in App.tsx are out of scope for Task 2).

### Potential concerns to address:

- **None.** Types are pure data structures with no logic or side effects. No external dependencies added. Ready for use by state management + API layers in subsequent tasks.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 20:38 PDT — v0.3.2 (Task 1: Vitest setup)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Installed Vitest + Testing Library (React, user-event, jest-dom) as the foundation for frontend unit and integration testing throughout Spec 1. Added test scripts to package.json (test, test:watch, test:ui, dev:proxy). Created vitest.config.ts with jsdom environment and global test APIs enabled. Created src/test-setup.ts for Testing Library configuration. Verified pnpm test runs cleanly with exit code 0 and detects "no test files" state as expected.

### Detail of changes made:

- **`package.json`** — `pnpm add -D vitest @vitest/ui @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom @types/ws` installed 7 dev dependencies (94 transitive). Added 4 scripts: `test` (vitest run), `test:watch` (vitest), `test:ui` (vitest --ui), `dev:proxy` (node vp-edge-mock/server.mjs, intentionally references nonexistent file for now — created in Task 16). Preserved existing dev, build, tauri scripts.
- **`vitest.config.ts`** (created) — exports Vitest config with React plugin, jsdom environment, globals enabled, setupFiles pointing to src/test-setup.ts, include pattern for *.test.ts(x) and *.spec.ts(x) under src/, passWithNoTests: true so "no tests found" exits with code 0 (expected baseline before tests are written).
- **`src/test-setup.ts`** (created) — one-liner importing @testing-library/jest-dom/vitest to extend matchers (toBeInTheDocument, etc.).

### Potential concerns to address:

- **passWithNoTests: true added to vitest.config.ts** — this is a minor deviation from the original plan task description which expected "exit code 0 is fine" but didn't specify how. Vitest's default is exit code 1 when no tests found; passWithNoTests: true makes it exit 0, which aligns with the intent ("exit code 0 is fine"). This setting will be removed or clarified once tests are written and the baseline shifts. (Acceptable — improves CI/CD flow for subsequent commits that may have zero tests in their test suite mid-implementation.)

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 20:35 PDT — v0.3.2 (infra: gitignore for env backups)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Added `.env.local.*` glob to `.gitignore` so timestamped backups of `.env.local` (created when adding new secrets like the Deepgram API key) are automatically excluded from git history. Pure infra — no code changes.

### Detail of changes made:

- **`.gitignore`** — added `.env.local.*` after the existing `.env.local` line. Pattern matches `.env.local.backup-*`, `.env.local.bak`, etc. Verified with `git check-ignore -v`.

### Potential concerns to address:

- **None.** Pattern is conservative (only matches `.env.local.*` prefix); does not affect any other tracked files.

## Progress Update as of 2026-05-02 19:55 PDT — v0.3.2 (no version bump; infra fix + plan kickoff)
*(Most recent updates at top)*

### Summary of changes since last update

Initial commit on this branch — replaced the LLM-validator pre-commit hook with a deterministic shell-command hook so subagent-driven implementation of Spec 1 can commit cleanly. The previous hook (`type: "prompt"`) asked an LLM agent to verify the per-branch progress log was updated, but the validator can't see file writes from the same session and false-blocked legitimate commits roughly ~80% of the time. The new hook (`type: "command"`) deterministically checks `git diff --cached --name-only` for the expected progress-log path derived from the current branch name (slashes mapped to dashes). Exit 0 to allow, exit 2 with a clear stderr message to block. No source code changes in this commit; infra-only.

### Detail of changes made:

- **`.claude/settings.json`** — replaced the `type: "prompt"` PreToolUse hook with a `type: "command"` hook. Command derives `branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)`, `fname=$(printf '%s' "$branch" | tr / -)`, then checks if `prd/branch commit updates/${fname}.md` is in the staged file list. Exit code controls allow/block. The `if: "Bash(git commit:*)"` filter is preserved so the hook only runs on git commit invocations, not other Bash calls.
- **No code changes** — this is infrastructure only. Spec 1 implementation work begins on subsequent commits via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`.

### Potential concerns to address:

- **The settings watcher caveat**: Claude Code's settings watcher only observes directories that had a settings file at session start. `.claude/settings.json` existed at session start (with the old prompt hook), so the watcher should pick up the change. Verified by an earlier successful commit (`5a7a623` on `feature/cloud-share-secret-link`) that used this same hook.
- **The hook has no false-negative path**: a future change that renames the per-branch log convention or moves the file would silently allow commits without log updates. Acceptable trade-off — the hook is documented in CLAUDE.md and any rename would be a deliberate convention change with humans in the loop.
- **The hook's grep is exact-line-match (`grep -qxF`)**: handles spaces in the path correctly but is strict on whitespace. Path differences (e.g., trailing slash, weird quoting) would silently miss-match. The format `git diff --cached --name-only` outputs is stable, so this should be fine.
- **Existing hook fix landed on `feature/cloud-share-secret-link` (commit `5a7a623`)** but that commit was reverted/re-reverted by the user before being merged to main. This branch re-applies the same fix so it lands via the Spec 1 implementation merge. If the cloud-share branch is ever merged back, expect a trivial settings.json conflict — both branches contain the same fix, so resolution is "accept either."
